### _**Begin. Begin again.** Begin again a gain. A gain, a loss. Give it another toss. Let go. Breathe in. Exhale, and do it again. Learning to enjoy this cycle is the **ultimate win**._

webappzero.com aims to improve the learning experience for all of us who seek mastery in web application design and development. Truthfully, it's a monumental task: learn to program, make stuff look good, work good, be easy to understand, all while building something that people actually need or want.

Are you eager to learn to program or to build web apps but struggling to find a path forward, a path that feels right in your gut?

If so, I have some great stuff to share with you!

So, who am I and why should you consider listening? I'm Jay. Compared to a real master, I don't know jack. But if I've become expert at something over these past 3 years, it's this: How not to get started programming!

That's right. I'm good at doing it the wrong way. And I can save you A LOT of time and even more importantly, _**frustration**_.

I don't have enough time or space in this post to give you all the details of this path forward, but that is my first priority over the coming months. By New Years 2017, you will find here a detailed video explanation of the path and its motivations, me looking you in the eye and sharing with you, for free, the _what_ and _why_ of the path. While there's no one 'right' path that will fit both you and me perfectly, I do think there's a lot of wrong ways to go.

This will be an opinionated path. If you want to be a software developer working at a large corporation, this path may not be a good fit. Many such employers desire that you have general knowledge in many languages to show that you can learn quickly and adapt. You'd get some of that here and you're very welcome stay and learn, but you might be better off with a more formal education.

Have you decided to learn to program at home? Or to become a self-guided learner? Me too! It can be a lonely quest. That's why I want to reach out and connect with you. It's good for me too. If you want to build awesome solutions to real world problems that make people's lives better, if you want to be able wrap your head around the stuff you're creating and find real joy in the craft, then I believe you are in the right place, at the right time, and I'm eager to help you learn more.

This site is about [Mastery][0]. Though I'm not a master yet, I've surrounded myself with [them][1]. My strategy for learning is to help make their lives easier and better in some meaningful way to them, thus conditioning them to welcome me more intimately into their world, so that I can learn from their experience and avoid more mistakes!

If you have capital, a project and need help now, I recommend that you talk to [Cognitect][2], the creators and stewards of Clojure & Datomic about how they can help you. Also, I just love the feeling of knowing that if I get my project into a jam I can pick up the phone and get the exact help I need. There's probably a Clojure expert near you no matter where you live --- [England][3], [Europe][4] etc.

I have some experimental ideas about how we can better support **open source software projects**, while increasing access to Masters for those of us eager to learn. **This is what I'm most excited about right now.**

This is a real company with meaningful goals. We've already supported one open-source project, [Arachne][5] by funding their Kickstarter at the maximum level. We want to support more open source projects in the near future. **You can really make a difference here!**

Maybe you're curious. Cool, you can [subscribe][6] to our mailing list to stay informed.

Maybe you're eager and want to get started now. Go take this course: **[How to Code: Systematic Program Design][7]**

While you're at it, and preferably even before the above course, the following course is of critical importance for everyone here: [Learning How to Learn][8] (It's only 4 hours and will dramatically increase your effectiveness!)

With the money we save on tuition, some of us will choose to splurge on investments to save ourselves more time and frustration. Like a printer that prints both side of a flash card automatically. I'm developing a workflow to share with you whereby you can create flash cards as you study and work on projects. Then you study the flash cards in bed, within 30 minutes of going to sleep which deeply embeds the information in your memory.

We're going to dig into Clojure, ClojureScript, Datomic, React, React-Native, Z shell and a handful of supporting technologies like git etc.

I've got some really cool surprises for you soon. Our videos are going to be unique, but hopefully not for long. Once other people see what we're doing, our hope is that this new, unrevealed technique will catch on, improving the tutorial market as a whole.

Some monumental goals indeed. Things that are built on simplicity only appear difficult at first. Once familiar, you will be able master this domain and create a better future for yourself, me and others. Me, You, Us. This triad inspires me deeply and I've got some ideas about how we can, optionally, 'earn while we learn' in equal portions (quasi-partnering) along our path to shared Mastery.

Let us begin.

My best,
