Learn what half-screen computer training is, why it's helpful and how to get started using it today.

## Introduction

Hi there! This is Jay with web app zero and this post introduces the concept of half-screen training.

Have you ever noticed that many programming videos needlessly take up the entire screen of your laptop? Imagine videos which only take up half the screen, allowing you to easily follow the steps in the video right on your local system, playing/pausing/rewinding the video as desired, all while inside the comfort and familiarity of your favorite text editor or programming environment. Imagine being able to focus deeply on a lesson's content rather than on switching back and forth between your video tutorial and text editor.  
Good news! You don't have to imagine it, half-screen training is the solution you've been waiting for and it's freely available to instructors and learners the world over.

## What is half-screen training?

Half-Screen training is really just a set of conventions and practices adhered to by the people who produce the half-screen videos and also by those who follow, or watch, the videos. Let's look at an example video to get the full picture...

## Example Video

### Video Script:

\[First, I'm going to copy the URL of a half-screen friendly video.

Next, I'll open the VLC video player on my local system.

Then, in VLC, I'll click on ~File~, then ~Open Network~, and paste the video's URL into the ~URL~ field.

Now I can control the playback of this video with a set of globally registered keyboard shortcuts. But first, let me open Dr Racket on my local system.

Now I can play, pause and rewind the video, while remaining inside Dr Racket. Let me demonstrate:

I'm now pressing the keyboard shortcut to play the video.

Now I'm going to pause the video with a key stroke.

Now I'm going to rewind the video 10 seconds with a key stroke. The rewind time span can be adjusted. And you can also rewind the video while its playing.

This control is also possible from within Emacs, Vim, Terminal, IntelliJ, or any other text editor or application.

It works for controlling online streaming videos found at You Tube, Vimeo and elsewhere. It works for videos on your local system. And, of course, it works for full-screen videos too, which is good because sometimes you actually do need the full screen to make your point. In which case, the learner can revert to using the normal methods of switching between applications, typically by pressing the SUPER and TAB keys simultaneously.

Instructions on how to get Half-Screen Training setup on your system will we provided at the end of this video.\]
